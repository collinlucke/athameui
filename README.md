# athameUI 🗡️

A sharp React component library that's a cut above... sorry, not sorry.

This project is still very much a work in progress. Primarily, I'm using it for one of my other projects, so, for the time being, I'm only creating components as I need them.

But feel free to look about. You can clone it and try it out, if you feel so inclined.
